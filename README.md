# DSA-BridgeCourse-Assignment-2
Contains source code implementation of Data Structures & Algorithms Bridge Assignment Questions in C

1. There is a singly linked list given to you. Find if the Loop exists in the Linked list or not
and also find the point where the loop is happening if the loop is present.

2. There is a singly linked list given to you. Reverse the Linked list using stack and also
using recursion.

3. You are given a node pointer to the singly linked list, you need to delete that node value,
such that you donâ€™t have access to its parent node and also that node is not a tail node.

4. You are given two sorted singly linked lists, merge them such that the final list is also
sorted.

5. You are given two singly linked lists that merge with each other at some node and
become single linked lists. Find the merging point of both linked lists.

6. Tell whether the linked list is palindrome or not.

7. Implement the Queue data structure using stack.

8. Perform BFS and DFS Traversal of BST created in Assignment 1. (DFS using recursion
and Stack)

9. Create Heaps using Arrays and also Priority Queue

10. Verify if a tree is symmetric around its center i.e: left subtree = right subtree at every
node.
